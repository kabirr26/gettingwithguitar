                <h3 class="text-center">By Kabir Rao</h3>
                <p>Have you ever thought about learning guitar? Many express interest in playing guitar but choose to avoid it because they perceive it as an extremely difficult hobby that must be started when young. However, few realize just how easy beginning guitar can be. It truly only takes learning four major chords to be able to play thousands of songs – and the rewards that come with taking on a new instrument are endless. So without further ado, let’s break down what it takes to get started on an acoustic adventure.</p>

            <p>Before you begin, you’ll want to make sure that you have the proper materials. The nice thing about the guitar as compared to many other instruments is that there is very minimal equipment. Besides the guitar being easily transportable, the instrument is unique in that a musician can get from it both rhythm and solo ability. Alongside your acoustic guitar, you should consider having a capo, a strap, a soft case, a set of guitar picks, and a free tuner app. If you have these few things, you’ll soon realize that you are already well on your way to playing your favorite tunes.</p>

                <p>Let’s get into it. Before even starting to strum your guitar, it is important to understand the anatomy of your instrument. There are a few main components of your guitar: the rounded body, the slender neck, and the head stock with knobs for tuning. Along the neck, there are lines to demarcate frets and we refer to this whole thing as the fretboard. Where you place your fingers along the fretboard will alter how notes sound so it is very important to stay within the frets rather than straddle in between. </p>
                <p>Next, we will want to look at the strings. It is important that when sitting, you keep your back straight and your guitar lodged across your thigh. If you are right-handed, you will be using your left hand to form chord shapes along the fret board while your right hand will be used to strum or pluck at the strings over the hole in the body. Each string corresponds to a single note. Looking down at your strings in the position that you would be holding the guitar, from top to bottom, the strings read as follows: E, A, D, G, B, E. An easy way to remember this is to think, “Eddie ate dynamite. Goodbye Eddie.” This acronym will prove useful and help you remember which note to be playing.
                </p>
                <p>You should also be aware of what fingers you are playing your guitar with. The standard technique of understanding this is with the number system. Your thumb will be used to help steady the neck and will occasionally wrap around if you intend to mute the low E string, so for now, do not worry about it. Under the system, each number from 1 to 4 corresponds to a finger on your hand. Per this system, 1 refers to your index finger, 2 refers to your middle finger, 3 refers to your ring finger, and 4 refers to your pinky. Make sure to watch out for these numbers when looking at chord breakdowns as playing chords with the right hand placement will make transitioning between chords much easier.
                </p>
                <p>Now that we have some basic understanding of our instrument, it’s time for the fun part! As a beginner, you may get stressed when attempting to learn what many refer to as “cowboy” chords but fear not. You will find that with practice, your playing will improve rapidly and significantly. It sounds cliché but it really does only take five minutes a day to see a drastic improvement after about a month of playing. Need proof? Within a week, you should start to see hard calluses develop on your left fingertips – these will help you press down more firmly.
                </p>
                <p>There are chord diagrams below to help you begin learning the four chords you should start with. Probably the easiest to learn is E minor (Em) so I recommend that you try learning this one first. As you will see, the chord consists of your index finger on the second fret of the A string and your middle finger on the second fret of the D string. Once again, you will need to quickly know the finger, fret, and string for each note.

            <div class="col-12 col-md-10">
                <p>Make sure you are pressing down hard with the part of your finger just under the nail. When you can feel no space between your string and the fret board, strum with your right hand while still keeping your left fingers firmly pressed down. If you are playing the chord properly, you should not hear any vibrations beyond the intended chord. Once you have Em down, try going through the other chords outlined in the diagrams.</p>
                <p>If you feel comfortable enough playing these chords individually, try switching between them and improving your speed. Keep practicing the finger shape of each chord until it becomes muscle memory and then switch to another. This is something easy to do wherever you are. Perhaps the best and quickest way to practice this is to do so while watching TV. You’ll find yourself soon being able to switch quickly and without looking away from the screen.
                </p>
                <p>Once you can switch quick between these four chords in any different order, it’s time to start learning your first song. What you’ll want to do is pick a beginner song that contains only these four chords. Look up the Chords page for this song on Ultimate Guitar Tabs, a comprehensive website that has many user-posted chord versions for thousands of songs. This page will also contain strumming pattern. You can practice these strumming patterns by muting all strings and playing to a metronome or simply by trying the song “by feel”. Singing or humming along will also help you establish the flow of the song. Need help picking a song? Take a look at some of the most famous options below.

                <p>As you play more and more guitar, your play will improve. Like with anything, practice makes perfect, so don’t be afraid to keep trying new things even if it seems frustrating. Hopefully, this helped introduce you to the beautiful world of guitar. With time, you will begin to learn more major and minor chords as well as barre chords and eventually licks and solo guitar. This will all come with time. But at least for now, when someone at a party asks you to “just play something”, you will feel confident in your ability to do just that!</p>
                <p>Playing guitar means different things to different people. For me, it is a chance to escape and get in touch with my creative side while simultaneously pursuing my passion for music. Music is truly the universal language and the guitar is a great way to meet new people and strike up conversations. If you don’t believe me, just take a listen to what an intermediate guitarist had to say about the instrument and the power it holds in his life.
